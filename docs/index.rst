Spectacle
*********

Spectacle is an automated model generator for producing models that represent
spectral data. It features the ability to reduce spectral data to its absorption
or emission components, fit features and continua, as well as allow for
statistical analysis of spectral regions.

This package can also be used to generate analytical spectra from detailed
characteristics, find potential line features, and simultaneously fit sets of
absorption/emission lines.
