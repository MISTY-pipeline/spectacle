Spectacle is an automated model generator for producing models that represent
spectral data. It features the ability to reduce spectral data to its absorption
or emission components, fit features and continua, as well as allow for
statistical analysis of spectral regions.

This package can also be used to generate analytical spectra from detailed
characteristics, find potential line features, and simultaneously fit sets of
absorption/emission lines.

Quick example
-------------

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center
    :context: close-figs

    Include some setup imports for plotting and unit support.

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    >>> from astropy.visualization import quantity_support
    >>> quantity_support()  # for getting units on the axes below  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT

    Import the spectral model and profile model.

    >>> from spectacle.modeling import Spectral1D, OpticalDepth1D

    Create some HI lines to add to the spectral model.

    >>> line = OpticalDepth1D("HI1216", v_doppler=50 * u.km/u.s, column_density=14)
    >>> line2 = OpticalDepth1D("HI1216", delta_v=100 * u.km/u.s)

    Create the multi-component spectral model, defining a rest wavelength and
    explicitly defining some redshift value.

    >>> spec_mod = Spectral1D([line, line2], continuum=1, z=0, output='flux')

    Generate spectral data from the model.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-500, 500, 1000) * u.Unit('km/s')
    >>> y = spec_mod(x) * u.Unit('erg / Angstrom / cm^2 / s')

    Plot the result.

    >>> f, ax = plt.subplots()  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    >>> ax.set_title("HI 1216")  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    >>> ax.step(x, y)  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
